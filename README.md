# nmap_quick_script
A short nmap script written in Python3 that I use to automate daily nmap scans for work.

I usually have to run three different nmap scans against a client's scope of IP addresses and output those results to various file formats. With this script, I can perform all three scans in one command. 

Usage: python3 nmap_quick_script.py ip_list_file
